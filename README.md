# Project 3: Web Security
For this project we needed to complete 3 SQL injections, 3 XSS attacks, and 2 CSRF attacks. This was done to a web server provided by the university in order to learn how these attacks work in a controlled environment.

# How to Run
These attacks only work on the specified web server from the university, which means they cannot be run. However, the code and URLs are provided for viewing purposes.
